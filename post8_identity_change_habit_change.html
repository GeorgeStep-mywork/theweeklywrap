           <p>Why is it so easy to repeat bad habits and so hard to form good ones? It often feels difficult to keep good habits going for more than a few days, even with sincere effort and the occasional burst of motivation. 
          </p>
           <p>It's because we try to change the wrong thing. To understand what I mean, consider that there are three levels at which change can occur.
          </p>

           <img src="img/layers_behaviour_change.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">

           <p><strong>The first layer is changing your outcomes.</strong> This level is concerned with changing your results: losing weight, publishing a book, winning a championship. Most of the goals you set are associated with this level of change.</p>

           <p><strong>The second layer is changing your process. </strong>This level is concerned with changing your habits and systems: implementing a new routine at the gym, decluttering your desk for better workflow, developing a meditation practice. Most of the habits you build are associated with this level. </p>

           <p><strong>The third and deepest layer is changing your identity. </strong>This level is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level. </p>

           <p><em><strong>Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.</strong></em></p>

           <p>Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.
        </p>

        <img src="img/layers_behaviour_change_2.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">

        <p>Imagine two people resisting a cigarette. When offered a smoke, the first person says, “No thanks. I’m trying to quit.” It sounds like a reasonable response, but this person still believes they are a smoker who is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behaviour will change while carrying around the same beliefs.</p>

        <p>The second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a smoker.” It’s a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in identity.
        </p>

       <p><em><strong>True behaviour change is identity change. 
      </strong></em></p>

      <p>For example, “Who is the type of person who could write a book?” It’s probably someone who is consistent and reliable. Now your focus shifts from writing a book (outcome-based) to being the type of person who is consistent and reliable (identity-based).
      </p>

      <p><em><strong>The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not getting a particular outcome.</strong></em></p>

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
