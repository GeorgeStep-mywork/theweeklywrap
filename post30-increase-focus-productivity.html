This is while our focus is directly linked to our stress level, productivity and level of happiness.\n</P>\n<P>Our digital devices with all the dings, beeps, rings and buzzes are one of the sources of distraction that are lowering our attention span and wiring our brain for more distraction. This has a negative impact on our mental health, performance, and sense of well-being.\n</P>\n<P>However, there are simple ways we can increase our focus and productivity and look after our mental health and well-being. Here are 3 ways:\n</P>\n<H2 class=\"section-heading\">1. Avoid multitasking\n</H2>\n<P>When we are busy, multi-tasking may seem like a good idea at first. But the truth is that our brain cannot multitask. It switches between tasks rapidly, so it appears to us that we are multi-tasking.\n</P>\n<P>Switching from one task to another lowers your focus and your productivity. It takes more energy from your brain and it only adds to your stress. To increase focus and productivity,<B> it is more efficient to do one thing at a time with full attention.</B> This helps you to finish each task more quickly with more efficiency and less stress.\n</P>\n<H2 class=\"section-heading\">2. Create “Mindful Distraction”\n</H2>\n<P>Mindful Distraction is a concept and a technique that was created by Dr. Narjes Gorjizadeh to use the distractions of our modern world in a positive way. It is based on the technique of mindfulness, which is an ancient technique and a scientific process to train the mind to learn to remain in the present moment and be focused. One of the mostly used techniques of mindfulness is paying attention to one’s breath.\n</P>\n<P>Thousands of studies in the past few decades confirm the positive effects of mindfulness on our mental and physical health, and our life experiences. Increased focus, reduced stress, better sleep, and increased happiness are amongst its many benefits.\n</P>\n<P>Having a daily mindfulness practice is an effective way to slow down the mind and retain its focus. With Mindful Distraction technique, you can add micro mindfulness doses to your daily routine to reap the benefits of mindfulness in a simple way.\n</P>\n<P><B>To practice Mindful Distraction, whenever you hear a notification sound from your digital devices, pause for a moment and take a mindful breath.</B> For one inhale and one exhale, focus on your breath with full attention. This simple practice trains your mind and wires your brain to be focused, the opposite of what the distraction does to the brain.\n</P>\n<P>Adults check their phones on average 50-80 times a day. With Mindful Distraction, you can become mindful of this many times during the day and train your attention muscles frequently to increase your focus and productivity.\n</P>\n<P>You can do this technique not only when your phone distracts you, but when you face a distraction of any sort. Even when your own mind distracts you, take a pause and practice a moment of Mindful Distraction.\n</P>\n<H2 class=\"section-heading\">3. Slow down\n</H2>\n<P>In our modern societies, speed is rewarded. It is a common belief that we are doing better when we are doing more. However, constant activity and not being able to slow down causes stress, and lowers focus and productivity. While the world is speeding up, we can be mindful of the speed and consciously slow down to protect our attention, focus, productivity, and mental health.\n</P>\n<BR/>\n<P>If we don’t slow down consciously, we can easily get overwhelmed by the endless to-do things, running an endless race, without feeling content. <B>Practice to schedule your days in such a way that you have at least a few minutes for yourself every day to relax and have a quality time for yourself each day to connect with yourself.</B> This enhances your brain’s activity and increases your focus and productivity.",
