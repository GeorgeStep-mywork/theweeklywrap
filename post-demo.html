                    <p>If you want to build and maintain a positive attitude, you need to consciously practice and following steps:</p>

            <h2>Step 1: Change Focus, Look for the Positive
            </h2>

            <p class="ex">LOOK FOR THE GOLD Andrew Carnegie came to America from Scotland as a young boy. He started out by
                doing odd jobs and ended up as one of the largest steel manufacturers in the United States. At one time, he had
                43 millionaires working for him. A million dollars is a lot of money today, but in the 1920s it was worth much
                more. Someone once asked Mr. Carnegie how he dealt with people. Andrew Carnegie replied, “Dealing with
                people is a lot like digging for gold: When you go digging for an ounce of gold you have to move tons of dirt
                before you get to an ounce of gold, but when you go digging, you don’t go looking for the dirt, you go looking
                for the gold.” Andrew Carnegie’s reply has a very important message. Though sometimes it may not be apparent
                there is something positive in every person and every situation. We have to dig deep to look for the positive.
                Andrew Carnegie’s message is very clear: Become a gold digger. Change focus. Look for the positive.</p>
                
                
           <p>Some don’t see the doughnut, they only see the hole</p>

           <p>Being a positive thinker does not mean one has to agree or accept everything. It only means that a person is
            solution-focused. Spend so much time improving yourself that you have no time left to criticise others. Be too big for worry and
            too noble for anger.</p>

            <h2>Step 2: Make a Habit of Doing It Now</h2>

        <p>The unfortunate part of life is as Oliver Wendall Holmes said, “Most people go to their graves, with music still
            in them.”</p>

        <p>A completed task is fulfilling and energising; an incomplete task drains energy.</p>

        <p>Some people practice procastination by hiding behind high-sounding words, saying "I'm analysing" a month later and six months later they are still analysing. What they don't realise is that they are suffering from a disease called: Paralysis by Analysis and they will never succeed.</p>

        <p>Then there is another breed of people who say “I’ll do it when I become an expert.” They don’t understand that unless you do it, you’ll never become an expert. </p>

        <p>When people say, “I will do it one of these days,” you can be sure it means none of these days.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: Develop an Attitude of Gratitude</h2>

        <P>It is a great philosophy to live by, ‘never forget what others have done for you and never remember what you have done for others’. Count your blessings, not your troubles.</P>

        <H2>Step 4: Get into a Continuous Education Program</H2>

        <P>Intellectual education influences the head and values-based education influences the heart.</P>

        <p>A person who is morally educated will be a lot better equipped to move up in life or succeed than a morally bankrupt person, with excellent academic qualifications.</p>

        <br>

        <h2>Step 5: Build High Self-Esteem</h2>

        <p>Self-esteem is the way we feel about ourselves.</p>

        <p>Feeling good is a natural outcome of doing good; and doing good is a natural outcome of being good</p>

        <img src="img/Skillshare-Review-1280x640.png" class="img-fluid">

        <h2>Step 6: Stay Away from Negative Influences</h2>

        <p>Negative influences are negative people, drugs, alcohol, pornography, profanity etc. All negative influences pull people down. It depletes energy that could have been used constructively, to achieve new heights.</p>

        <p>A person’s character is judged not only by the company they keep but also by the company they avoid. If you associate with achievers, you will become one.</p>

        <em><p>Input determines output</p></em>

        <h2>Step 7: Learn to Like the Things That Need to be Done</h2>

        <p><em>Start by doing what is necessary, then what is possible and suddenly you are doing the impossible. – St. Francis of Assisi</em></p>

        <h2>Step 8: Start Your Day with Something Positive</h2>

        <p>Read or listen to something positive first thing in the morning. It sets the tone of the day and puts us in the right frame of mind to make the day a positive day.</p>

        <h2>Winners versus Losers</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>The Winner is always part of the solution; The Loser is always part of the problem.</li>

            <li>The Winner sees a solution for every problem; The Loser sees a problem for every answer.</li>

            <li>Winners see possibilities; Losers see problems.</li>

            <li>Winners use hard arguments but soft words; Losers use soft arguments but hard words.</li>

            <li>Winners make things happen; Losers wait for things to happen. Winners plan and prepare to win. The key word is preparation.</li>
        </ul>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
