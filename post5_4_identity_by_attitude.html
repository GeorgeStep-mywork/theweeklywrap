        <p>Charlie Chaplin, one of the world’s greatest comedians, was passing through a European country where he saw an advertisement for a Charlie Chaplin look-alike competition. Out of sheer inquisitiveness, he decided to participate. There were close to 500 people participating.
        </p>

        <p>To his total surprise, he came at number 7. Charlie Chaplin wrote in one of his memoirs that when he came at number 7, he was taken aback. He wrote, ‘We live in a world where showmen succeed and a real man fails. For a moment, even I got confused if I was the real Charlie Chaplin or the six before me. Then I realised that though the other six could copy my looks and moves, none of them could match my mind and my attitude.’ Charlie’s attitude was driven by high self-esteem, which came from self-acceptance and gave him his identity.</p>

        <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="img/charlie_chaplin_contest.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt=""></p>

        <p>He wrote, ‘I could laugh at life. I loved losing more than the winners enjoyed winning because I knew I was the real Charlie Chaplin.’</p>

        <p>One can even love to lose when one knows what one’s real identity is. Charlie Chaplin didn’t feel threatened as he didn’t have to prove anything to anyone. He writes further, ‘More than my appearance, my mind and my attitude give me my identity.’
        </p>

        <p>He was not looking at acceptance and validation from the world outside; he knew who he was. He knew his identity, so it didn’t matter to him who won. People who live with self-acceptance have high self-esteem— they are stable and balanced. They are at peace with themselves.
        </p>

        <p><em><strong>Are you getting your validation from inside, or outside? Are you internally driven or externally?
        </strong></em></p>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
