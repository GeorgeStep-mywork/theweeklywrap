            <p>How is it that under the same set of circumstances some people break records, while others break themselves? The difference lies in our ATTITUDE.
            </p>

            <p><em>
                <strong>Success does not depend on our position, but on our disposition, which is our attitude. </strong></em>It is well said that success depends 10 per cent on what happens to us and 90 per cent on how we respond.</p>

           <p>Thinking, believing and knowing what’s good is not good enough. DOING IS.</p>

           <p><em><strong>Become Solution- Focused, Not Problem- Focused </strong></em></p>

           <p>Many times in life, we discover new scenery, not because the landscape has changed, but because we are seeing it from a different perspective, and the difference is in our attitude. </p>

           <p>
           <em><strong>Attitude makes all the difference. It can make or break lives.</strong></em>
            </p>

            <p>What makes people exceptional? It is their attitude. Attitude is more powerful than skills, academic qualifications, good looks, place of birth, connections and everything else put together. Whenever we speak well about a man, do we refer to his looks, clothes, face or academic qualifications? No. We refer to his attitude.</p>

            <p><em>
                Attitude is a habitual way of thinking and feeling. </em>It is a viewpoint, a frame of mind, a thinking process and a way of looking at things. It is our standpoint, our approach to things or our reaction to situations in life.</p>

                <p>
            A pessimist says, ‘It may be possible, but it’s too difficult’, whereas an optimist says, ‘It may be difficult, but it’s possible’.</p>

        <p>Achievers look for solutions for every problem, and losers look for a problem in every solution.</p>

        <p class="ex">There is an ancient tale about a king who had a close friend, who always looked at the positives in life. To anything that happened, he would say, ‘It was for the good.’ One day, the king accidently cut his thumb and his friend, as expected, said that there must be something good in this. The king, who was in pain, lost his temper and sent him to jail. A few months later, the king went hunting and got lost in the woods. Inside the deep forest, a tribe held him captive, to offer as a sacrifice to their gods. As the priest was tying up his hands, he noticed that the king’s thumb was missing. Being superstitious, he felt that this would be an incomplete sacrifice and would attract divine rage. He set the king free. When the king came back, he introspected on his friend’s remark on ‘everything happening for the good’ when he had lost his thumb, and felt very remorseful. He went to his friend and apologised. The king said to his friend, ‘You were right. It was because I lost my thumb in that accident, that I am alive today. But wasn’t it bad that I sent you to jail?’ The friend said, ‘No it was for the good.’ The king wanted to know what was good about it. His friend replied, ‘If you had not sent me to jail, I would have accompanied you on the hunting trip, and today I would have been the one to be sacrificed.’</p>

        <p>If you analyse the story above, you will see that the objective is not to be fatalistic, but to be optimistic. Look for the positives. A positive thinker is an optimist. We cannot always change the circumstances, nor can we change the reasons or the seasons, but we can change ourselves.
        </p>

        <p>The only thing we have a choice in is the way we deal with the world. It is our attitude. 
        </p>

        <div class="ex"><p>Bruce Lee, the great martial artist, had one leg shorterthan the other by one inch, but he didn’t complain. He was near-sighted and had difficulty seeing an opponent without contacts or glasses.</p>
        <p>Despite these shortcomings, he practised 5,000 punches every day. No wonder, he became a martial arts legend. He made a choice to persist. He realised he had a problem, but he chose to turn it into a purpose. 
        </p>
        <p>Bruce Lee said, ‘I fear not the man who has practised 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practised one kick 10,000 times.’</p>
        </div>

        <p><em><strong>A Person With A Positive Attitude Cannot Be Stopped.<br>
            A Person With A Negative Attitude Cannot Be Helped.
            </strong></em></p>

          <!-- <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
