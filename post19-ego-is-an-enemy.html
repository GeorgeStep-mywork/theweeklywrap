            <p>Trump might have been afraid of the COVID -19 virus, but there was something he feared more, the appearance of being vulnerable. He didn’t want to show the world, that he was afraid of the virus. Thus, instead of modelling safety and protecting himself, he gave into his huge ego. Although people were becoming discontent, due to some of his decisions during his presidential term, we all know the thing that threw him off the edge is his mishandling of the covid situation. 
            </p>

            </p>


            <p>According to Ryan Holiday, the author of the book “ego is the enemy”, Ego is an <em><strong>“unhealthy belief in your own self-importance”.</strong></em> Ego is a false inflated self-image. Ego is the need to be recognized, become more, have more than others. 
            </p>

            <p>We can see this in Donald Trump, who considered wearing a mask as a sign of “weakness” and chose to risk not wearing the mask and risked himself contracting the virus. 
            </p>
            
            <p>People often confuse between self-esteem and ego. Ego and Self-esteem can never be the same. Individuals having a big ego, think they are building their self-esteem. However, the exact opposite is happening. The more the ego, the lesser the self-esteem, and vice versa. Self-esteem is a feeling of acceptance with self as it is. A person with high self-esteem accepts himself/herself as they are, with all the strengths and weaknesses. They don’t create a false self-image about themselves, they accept whoever they are in reality while seeking to better themselves. 
            </p>

            <p>A huge ego brings out a lot of unwanted changes in us such as converting self-confidence to arrogance and self-image to obsession. Therefore, ego is the enemy, of whatever you want to do. You can never master any skill, with a huge ego. 
            </p>

            <p><em><strong>Where ego destroys self-confidence builds. 
            </strong></em></p>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
