          <p>The greatest job security is ‘performance’.
          </p>

          <p>Superachievers don’t waste time in unproductive thoughts, esoteric thoughts or catastrophic thoughts. They think constructively and they know that their level of thinking determines their success. – Dr Seymour Epstein
          </p>

          <p>Success is not an accident. It is the result of your attitude and your attitude is a choice. Hence success is a matter of choice and not chance. The common man seeks security, whereas the uncommon man seeks opportunity.
          </p>

          <p>If you really want to succeed, form the habit of doing things that failures don’t like to do. – Anonymous
          </p>

          <em><strong>
            Success is the progressive realisation of a worthy goal. – Earl Nightingale</strong></em>


          <p>’Progressive’ means that success is a journey, not a destination. It’s an ongoing process. We never arrive.</p>

          <p>’Realisation’ means it is an experience. Outside forces cannot make me feel successful. I have to feel it within myself. It is internal not external. That is why what often appears success externally may be total hollowness internally. No wonder we hear of some celebrities and billionaires taking drugs and committing suicide because they feel emptiness internally.</p>

          <p>’Worthiness’ determines the quality of our journey. Can people have unworthy goals in their lives? The answer is, Yes! What makes a goal worthy? It is our value system which determines the quality of our journey. Worthiness is what gives meaning and fulfilment. Success without fulfilment is empty. That’s like good looks without goodness. In life, we need substance over form, not form over substance.</p>

          <p>‘Goals’—Goals are important because they give us a sense of direction. Our destination determines the direction we take.</p>

          <p>Success and happiness go hand in hand. Success is getting what you want and happiness is wanting what you get.</p>

          <p>I don’t know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody. – Bill Cosby</p>
        <p>Success does not mean being liked and accepted by everyone. </p>

        <p>We need to strive for excellence, not perfection. Striving for perfection is neurotic; striving for excellence is progress. Excellence is a continuous improvement. It’s a lot easier to improve one per cent in a hundred different areas than to improve a hundred per cent in any one area. That is the winning edge!</p>

        <p><em>History has demonstrated that the most notable winners usually encountered heart-breaking obstacles before they triumphed. They won because they refused to become discouraged by their defeats. – B.C. Forbes</em></p>

        <p class="ex">A biology teacher was teaching his students how a caterpillar turns into a butterfly. He told the students that in the next couple of hours, the butterfly would struggle to come out of the cocoon, but no one should help the butterfly. Then he left.<br> 
          <br>
          The students were waiting and it happened. The butterfly struggled to get out of the cocoon and against the advice of the teacher, one of the students took pity on it and decided to help the butterfly out of the cocoon. He broke the cocoon to help the butterfly so it didn’t have to struggle any more. But, shortly afterwards, the butterfly died. When the teacher returned, he was told what had happened. He explained to the student that it is a law of nature that the struggle to come out of the cocoon actually helps develop and strengthen the butterfly’s wings. By helping the butterfly, the boy had deprived the butterfly of its struggle and the butterfly died.

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
