            <p>IN 1993, A bank in Abbotsford, Canada, hired a twenty-three-year-old stock broker named Trent Dyrsmid. Abbotsford was a relatively small suburb, tucked away in the shadow of nearby Vancouver, where most of the big business deals were being made. Given the location and the fact that Dyrsmid was a rookie, nobody expected too much of him. But he made brisk progress thanks to a simple daily habit.</p>

            <p>Dyrsmid began each morning with two jars on his desk. One was filled with 120 paper clips. The other was empty. As soon as he settled in each day, he would make a sales call. Immediately after, he would move one paper clip from the full jar to the empty jar and the process would begin again.
            </p>

            <p>Within eighteen months, Dyrsmid was bringing in $5 million to the firm. By age twenty-four, he was making $75,000 per year—the equivalent of $125,000 today. Not long after, he landed a six-figure job with another company.
            </p>

          </div>

          <p>Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures—like moving paper clips provide clear evidence of your progress. As a result, they reinforce your behaviour and add a little bit of immediate satisfaction to any activity.

        <h2 class="section-heading">How To Keep Your Habits On Track
        </h2>

        <p>A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit. The most basic format is to get a calendar and cross off each day you stick with your routine. For example, if you meditate on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, each of those dates gets an X. As time rolls by, the calendar becomes a record of your habit streak.
        </p>

        <p>Countless people have tracked their habits. Jerry Seinfeld reportedly uses a habit tracker to stick with his streak of writing jokes. In the documentary Comedian, he explains that his goal is simply to “never break the chain” of writing jokes every day. In other words, he is not focused on how good or bad a particular joke is or how inspired he feels. He is simply focused on showing up and adding to his streak.
        </p>

        <p>“Don’t break the chain” is a powerful mantra. Don’t break the chain of sales calls and you’ll build a successful book of business. 
        </p>

        <img src="img/habit_cal.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">

        <p class="text-center">The habit stacking + habit tracking formula is: <br>After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT].
        </p>

        <p>For example:
            <ul>
                <li>After I hang up the phone from a sales call, I will move one paper clip over. 
                </li>
                <li>After I finish each set at the gym, I will record it in my workout journal.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p><em><strong>Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible.
        </strong></em>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
