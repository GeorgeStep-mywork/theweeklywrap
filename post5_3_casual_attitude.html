          <p>For want of a nail, a kingdom was lost—this is a story about how a kingdom saw its downfall by someone’s sheer negligence. In the mid-fifteenth century, King Richard was facing one of the toughest battles of his life. 
        </p>

        <p>The King had a strong army and they were all prepared to defeat the enemy. He asked for his favourite horse to lead the troops. The blacksmith had shoed all the horses but ran out of iron to shoe the King’s main horse. They had no time to wait as the enemy was advancing. Eventually, the blacksmith fixed the shoe but could not guarantee that it would hold without the complete set of nails. King Richard’s horse was not prepared. 
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="img/forwantofanail.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid center"></p>

        <p>The armies clashed and in the thick of the battle, the King kept encouraging his troops. He galloped forward but barely had he gone a little distance when his horse’s shoe fell off, the horse stumbled and King Richard was thrown to the ground. The frightened animal ran away and the King was without a horse. His soldiers, unable to see their king, became demoralised and started running away too. Very soon, he was captured and the battle was over. 
        </p>

        <p>What a shame! Only because of the want of a nail, history changed forever. Imagine the far-reaching impact of a nail.
        </p>

        <p><em><strong>In the words of Benjamin Franklin, ‘For want of a nail, a shoe was lost; for want of a shoe, a horse was lost; for want of a horse, a battle was lost; for want of a battle, a kingdom was lost and all for the want of a horseshoe nail.’</strong></em>
        </p>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
