          <p>Dave, a musician from Halifax, Canada, was travelling with his band on a United Airlines flight via Chicago to Nebraska. On reaching his destination, Dave was horrified to find that the baggage handlers at United had damaged his 3500-dollar Taylor guitar. We would all have forgiven him for saying, ‘This is bad.’ But Dave didn’t say it!
         </p>
         <p>Instead, he wrote to the customer service folks at United, told them about the loss of his beloved guitar and sought compensation for it. While United acknowledged that the guitar had been broken, no compensation was forthcoming. He was referred from one department to another with each person blaming someone else for the unfortunate event. After nine months of persistent follow-up, the compensation was still nowhere in sight. Now we would have understood if Dave had said, ‘This is bad!’ He did not.
        </p>
        <p>Instead, with a little help from his friends in the band, he filmed a music video describing his experience. The song was titled United breaks guitars. And on 6 July 2009 he posted it on YouTube. By the end of the day, the video attracted over 150,000 hits. And by the end of the following month, viewer numbers had swelled to over 5 million. Twitter, Facebook and the blog world were all singing paeans to United breaks guitars. Dave was the new hero on the block.
        </p>
        <p>The head of customer services at United called Dave and offered to compensate him for the loss (and requested him to pull out the video). He declined the offer and asked United to pay the money to a charity instead (which they did).
        </p>
        <p>Dave now goes around the world speaking to corporates about his experience in customer service and the lessons he picked up along the way. Ever since he sang United breaks guitars, the cash registers haven’t stopped ringing. For Dave, United breaking the guitar wasn’t just good. It was great!
        </p>
        <p>Listen to the song and enjoy:

        <p>So the next time misfortune befalls, say, ‘This is good!’ And you will discover how empowering that can be. Instead of playing victim and wallowing in self-pity, the ‘This is good!’ attitude compels you to take ownership and do things that can be life-changing.

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
