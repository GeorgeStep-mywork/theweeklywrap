If this is a weak spot for you like it has been for me, here’s how you can get started:\n</P>\n<H2 class=\"section-heading\">1. Find Your Baseline\n</H2>\n<P>Try to be as honest as possible in your assessment of your confidence level. It’s easier to chart where you’re going and how much progress you need to make if you know where you’re starting from.\n</P>\n<H2 class=\"section-heading\">2. Focus On Your Strength\n</H2>\n<P>We all have one. If you’re not sure what your strength is, ask a good friend to point it out to you. I promise you that it’s there. Think of all the times you’ve succeeded while doing something you’re good at. You have that confidence inside you already. Build off that and get the ball rolling.\n</P>\n<H2 class=\"section-heading\">3. Be Grateful\n</H2>\n<P>Write down three things that you are grateful for each day. The more time we spend focused on what we are grateful for instead of dwelling on what we’re lacking the better we feel about ourselves and the faster our perspective in life changes for the better.\n</P>\n<H2 class=\"section-heading\">4. It’s Temporary\n</H2>\n<P>When you hit a rough patch, remind yourself that life is like an ocean. There are times where you’re riding high on a beautiful wave and times when that wave comes crashing down. The important thing to remember is that life is a cycle and you will inevitably get back up on that wave again.\n</P>\n<P><IMG src=\"img/Copy of “Winners have will power; losers have won’t power.”.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid\" style=\"\"/></P>\n<H2 class=\"section-heading\">5. Listen To Your Inner-voice\n</H2>\n<P>If I win or lose, that is just another life experience. It’s the act of taking a chance and doing something that you want to do when you know there is a chance of failing. That doesn’t mean that I’m going to get what I want or win every time. I won’t, but that doesn’t matter. What matters is being true to myself and who I am.\n</P>\n<H2 class=\"section-heading\">6. Be Your Best You\n</H2>\n<P>Take care of yourself. I don’t mean that you have to focus on looks. I mean put yourself first. If you don’t workout, sleep, meditate, relax or do whatever special things you need to do for you, you won’t be the best version of yourself. When you’re not your best version of yourself you can’t do things for others.\n</P>\n<H2 class=\"section-heading\">7. You Don’t Have To Be Perfect\n</H2>\n<P>No one is perfect. If you find someone who is trying to give the impression of being perfect, RUN! Those are the least confident and most insecure people. By letting the world see your flaws and imperfections, you boost your confidence and accept yourself. We just have to get to a place where you can appreciate them.\n</P>\n<H2 class=\"section-heading\">8. Practice\n</H2>\n<P>Put yourself in the best position for success. That means practicing, researching and preparing for whatever it is that you’re trying to do. Whatever the situation, you will feel more confident going in if you prepare and practice. You can’t control the outcome, but you can rest easy knowing that you did everything possible to prepare.\n</P>\n<H2 class=\"section-heading\">9. Fake It Till You Make It\n</H2>\n<P>This is a standby and it works. If you stand up tall, make eye contact, deliberately shake hands, smile and put on your best superhero gear you automatically appear like a confident person. Whether you have it or not at that moment is irrelevant because it appears like you do. People treat you differently when they think that you’re confident.\n</P>\n<H2 class=\"section-heading\">10. Give Back\n</H2>\n<P>It doesn’t have to be a big donation or a time-consuming gesture. It can be something small, like being polite by holding a door. This makes you realize that you are capable of bringing value to others. If you’re feeling low, try helping someone else out. Listen to their problems. They will appreciate you for that. Those confidence builders pop up around us every day. You’re the one who has to take the initiative and go after them. Work the confidence muscle daily and watch it grow!\n</P>\n\n<P><EM>Source: Confidence Creator by\n<A href=\"https://heathermonahan.com/\" class=\"sc\" target=\"blank\">Heather Monahan",

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
