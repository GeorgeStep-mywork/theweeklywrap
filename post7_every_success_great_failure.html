           <p>Failure is the highway to success. Tom Watson Sr, of IBM, said, “If you want to succeed, double your failure rate.” </p>
           <p>If you study history, you will find that all stories of success are also stories of great failures. The world only sees success. They don’t see the struggle behind the success, and say “He got lucky, he must have been at the right place at the right time.”</p>
           <p class="ex">Let me share a famous life history with you. This was a man who failed in business at the age of twenty-one; was defeated in a legislative race at age twenty-two; failed again in business at age twenty-four; had his sweetheart die when he was age twennty-six; had a nervous breakdown at age twenty-seven; lost a congressional race at age thirty-four; lost a senatorial race at age forty-five; failed in an effort to become vice-president at age forty-seven; lost a senatorial race at age forty-nine; and was elected president of the United States at age fifty-two. This man was Abraham Lincoln. </p>
           <p>With these many failures, if Lincoln had quit, probably nobody would have blamed him but nobody would remember him either.</p>
    

          <p>The greatest people in the world turn a setback into a comeback.</p>
          <p>
            As a young cartoonist, Walt Disney faced many rejections from newspaper editors who said he had no talent. One day a minister at a church hired him to draw some cartoons. Disney was working out of a small rodent-infested shed near the church. Seeing a small mouse inspired him to draw a new cartoon. That was the start of Mickey Mouse.</p>
        <p><em><strong>Success is not the absence of failure. It is overcoming failure. Successful people don’t do great things, they only do small things in a great way.</strong></em></p>

        <p class="ex">One day a partially deaf four years old child came home with a note in his pocket from his teacher, “Your Tommy is too stupid to learn, get him out of school.” His mother read the note and answered, “My Tommy is not too stupid to learn, I will teach him myself.” And that Tommy grew up to be the great Thomas Edison. Thomas Edison had only three months of formal schooling.</p>

        <p>Henry Ford forgot to put the reverse gear in the first car he made.</p>
        <p><em><strong>All success stories are stories of great failures. The only difference is that every time they failed, they bounced back. This is called failing forward, rather than backward.
        </strong></em></p>
        <p class="ex">In 1914, Thomas Edison, at age sixty-seven, lost his factory to fire. It had very little insurance. No longer a young man, Edison watched his lifetime effort go up in smoke and said, “There is great value in disaster. All our mistakes are burnt up. Thank God we can start anew.” In spite of disaster, three weeks later, he invented the phonograph. What an attitude!</p>

        <p><em><strong>Learn to become victors, not victims. Fear and doubt short-circuit the mind.</strong></em></p>
        <p>Success is not an accident. It is the result of our attitude. Going through life without using your ability to think is like shooting without aiming.</p>

        <p>Life is like a cafeteria. You take your tray, select your food and pay at the other end. You can get anything you want as long as you are willing to pay the price. In a cafeteria, if you wait for people to serve you, you will wait forever. Life is like that too. You make choices and pay the price to succeed.</p>

        <p><em><strong>We are all free to the point of making choices. but, after we make a choice, the choice controls the chooser. We have no more choices. What is success? Series of positive choices is called success and series of negative choices is called failure.</strong></em></p>

        <p>We can choose our attitude even though we cannot always choose our circumstances. The choice is either to act like a victor or a victim. It is not our position but our disposition that determines success. And what is disposition? It is our attitude.</p>

        <P>It takes both rain and sunshine to create a rainbow. Our lives are no different. There is happiness and sorrow. We cannot control all the events that happen in our lives, but we can control how we deal with them.</P>

        <P>Richard Blechnyden wanted to promote Indian tea at the St Louis World Fair. It was very hot and no one wanted to sample his tea. Blechnyden saw that iced drinks were doing a flourishing business. It dawned on him to make his tea into an iced drink, mix in some sugar and offer it for sale. People loved it. That was the introduction of iced tea to the world.</P>

        <p><em><strong>When things go wrong, as they sometimes will, you can react responsibly or resentfully—the choice is yours.</strong></em></p>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
