           <p class="ex">Many years ago, I heard the story of a man named Steve who was working under the hot sun as a labourer of a company. A limousine stopped by and a man shouted, ‘Steve come inside.’ Sitting in the limousine was John, the president of the company. Steve left all his work and sat inside the limousine. He exchanged pleasantries and had some cold water to drink. After a few minutes, they said goodbye to each other. Steve went back to work in the hot sun and John left. All Steve’s co-workers were rather impressed and asked him enviously, ‘How do you know John?’ Steve replied, ‘Not only do I know him, but both John and I started working together in this company, on the same day at the same position twenty-five years ago.’ Everyone was left even more surprised. They asked Steve, ‘How is it that both of you started working on the same day at the same position twenty-five years ago, and you are still working out in the hot sun and he has become the president of the company?’ The answer Steve gave says it all. He said, ‘Twenty-five years ago, John started working for the company and I started working for a dollar and twenty-eight cents an hour.’ No wonder, John rose up to become the president and Steve was still working as a labourer. John took ownership. He had a larger picture in mind—he worked towards making the company grow bigger rather than making only himself grow. He understood that the more he contributed towards the growth of the company, the more he would grow.

           <p>Nobody ever becomes an owner or an employee based on a pay-cheque. A pay-cheque doesn’t decide who is the owner or the employee. It is only the acceptance of ownership that decides the owner. Only when we feel like an owner within, do we behave like one. Our actions become those of an owner thereafter, and we take charge. A person who takes ownership, has a feeling of belonging. That means, ‘I belong to the organisation and the organisation belongs to me.’</p>

           <p>Whenever a person takes ownership, two things change drastically: 
               <ol>
                   <li>
                    Their problem-solving ability, and 
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    Their decision-making ability   
                   </li>
               </ol>            
            </p>

            <p><strong><em>What is leadership if not these two things put together?</em></strong></p>

            <p>Has it ever happened that you bought something from the store and something went wrong? You went back to the store and shouted at the person behind the counter. And the person said, ‘Why do you shout at me? I only work here. I’m just an employee.’</p>

            <p>When a person says, ‘I only work here’, what is he really saying? He is saying, ‘I have no feeling of belonging. I only come here for a pay-cheque.’</p>

            <p>
                When an employee treats an employer only as a ‘pay-cheque’, he will never make a good employee. Similarly, when an employer treats an employee only as a ‘money-making machine’, he will never make a good employer either. There must be a feeling of belonging that binds them together. It’s pretty common to see that <STRong>people who walk in for a few bucks will also walk out for a few bucks.</STRong>
            </p>

            <p>
                The most important factor that brings a feeling of belonging is when people feel connected because of a meaningful purpose.
            </p>

            <p>
                No matter what we do, we must take ownership!
